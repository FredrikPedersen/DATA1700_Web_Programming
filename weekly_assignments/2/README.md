# Week 2

Create a person registery program in JavaScript where some people are already added in an array when the program is first run.
By clicking a button the people who are in the registery are to be printed in a table.

Extra tasks:

1. Create functionality for adding more people to the registery.
2. Sort the array before printing to the web page.
3. Make every second line be bold.
4. Create a new column with national identity number.
5. Mark men or women with a different color text (hint: look at the 11th number in the NIN).
